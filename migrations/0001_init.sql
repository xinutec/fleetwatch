-- fleetwatch core schema: reports and their exploded checks.
--
-- A `report` is one upload from one producer run. `id` is the producer-minted
-- ULID and the idempotency key — re-sending the same report (spool replay after
-- a network flap) is a no-op. Per-report verdict counts are denormalised so the
-- overview needs no aggregation. `raw` keeps the original payload for
-- schema-evolution replay + debugging (pruned early; see report::retention).
--
-- Timestamps are stored as UTC DATETIME(3); the app binds/reads them as UTC
-- explicitly (never relying on the DB session timezone) and computes age in
-- Rust, so nothing here depends on the server's local time.
