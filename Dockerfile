# Multi-stage build for fleetwatch: Angular frontend + Rust backend, served from one
# image (the backend serves the bundle + API). Mirrors the fleet's image
# convention (xinutec/<app>:latest).

# --- frontend: build the Angular bundle ---
FROM node:24-alpine AS frontend
WORKDIR /fe
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/package-lock.json ./
# git: the shared layout harness is a git dependency (github:xinutec/ui-harness),
# so npm ci clones it — node:alpine ships no git.
RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates && npm ci
COPY frontend/ .
# Stamp the build version into the bundle (see scripts/stamp-version.mjs). The
# build context has no .git, so the commit comes from GIT_SHA (passed by CI —
# .github/workflows/docker.yml); it defaults to 'dev' for a plain local build.
ARG GIT_SHA=dev
RUN GIT_SHA="$GIT_SHA" node scripts/stamp-version.mjs
RUN npx ng build --configuration production

# --- backend: build the Rust binary (deps cached in their own layer) ---
FROM rust:1-bookworm AS backend
WORKDIR /app
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
# Prime the dependency cache with a stub crate, then build for real.
