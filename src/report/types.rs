//! Report + check types: the wire format producers POST, and the shapes the UI
//! reads back. Response types derive `TS` so `scripts/gen-types.sh` keeps the
//! Angular interfaces in lock-step (see frontend/src/app/generated/).
//!
//! Deliberate shape decisions (see docs/design.md §4.1):
//! - `source` is NOT in the upload — it's derived from the ingest token, so a
//!   producer can only write as itself.
//! - a check's trend identity is `(source, collector, section, label)`; `label`
//!   must be stable across runs, with run-varying data in `observed`/`value`.
//! - one optional numeric per check (`value`/`unit`) drives the trend charts.
