# fleetwatch web viewer (Android)

The `fleetwatch.xinutec.org` fleet monitoring dashboard presented as a native-feeling
app: a single full-screen **WebView**, no address bar, no tabs, a home-screen
icon. It avoids browser chrome while showing the UI exactly as designed (the
system WebView is Chromium, so it renders like Chrome).

The site is **private** — reachable only over the VPN — and has **no login**
(the VPN is the gate). The app needs only `INTERNET` (the VPN is set up at the
OS/network level, not by this app).

## What it does

- Loads `https://fleetwatch.xinutec.org/` — **hardcoded** (`MainActivity.FLEETWATCH_URL`);
  this app is single-purpose.
- JavaScript + DOM storage on (Angular), all navigation kept in-app, Back walks
  the SPA history; reopens on the last in-app page.
- Insets the WebView from the system bars by padding a wrapper, and paints the
  strips behind the bars with the page's own surface colour (read on load, so it
  tracks the Material light/dark theme).

Runs on any Android 8+ (minSdk 26) device. Must be on the VPN to reach the host.

## Build & install

No toolchain lives in this repo — it borrows the recall project's `android` nix
dev shell (JDK 17 + Android SDK; the Gradle wrapper pins Gradle):

```sh
cd android
nix develop ~/Code/recall#android --command ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
# → app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Or build + install to the Pixel 9 in one step (keys on device model, not IP):

```sh
nix develop ~/Code/recall#android --command ./deploy.sh
```

The APK is signed with the auto-generated debug key — fine for sideloading, the
only distribution path.
