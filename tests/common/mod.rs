//! Shared DB-test setup.
//!
//! Each `#[tokio::test]` runs on its OWN runtime, so a pool can't be shared
//! across tests — connections created on one test's runtime die when that
//! runtime shuts down, and a later test using them just hangs. So every test
//! gets its own pool. To keep that safe on a shared database we serialize the DB
//! tests behind one lock: it makes the (idempotent) migrations run one at a time
//! rather than racing, and stops a test that asserts on the *global*
//! `overview`/`problems` queries from overlapping another test's inserts.
//!
//! Returns `None` when FLEETWATCH_TEST_DATABASE_URL is unset, so DB tests skip cleanly
//! and the default `cargo test` needs no database.
